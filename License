# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name
Legacy Font Converter

---

## Problem Statement

Indian legal and DTP ecosystems still rely heavily on legacy (non-Unicode) fonts.
Operators are highly trained in these fonts, and retraining them is impractical.

Existing conversion tools are:
- Expensive
- Closed-source
- Inflexible
- Often inaccurate for legal use

---

## Product Goals

- Preserve existing typing workflows
- Produce legally compliant output fonts
- Provide deterministic, accurate conversions
- Support both offline desktop and online service models
- Enable future expansion to multiple scripts

---

## Target Users

- Court DTP shops
- Typing bureaus
- Legal documentation vendors
- Digitization agencies
- Small publishers

---

## In Scope (Phase 1)

- Gujarati script support
- Bhasha Bharti → Terafont Varun conversion
- Desktop application (offline)
- Text-based conversion (copy-paste)
- Deterministic output

---

## Out of Scope (Phase 1)

- OCR or scanned document processing
- PDF layout preservation
- Font distribution
- Cloud-only dependency

---

## Functional Requirements

1. Convert legacy font text deterministically
2. Preserve matras, reph, and conjuncts
3. Support documents up to 100 pages
4. Simple UI usable by non-technical operators
5. Batch-safe conversion logic

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Offline operation
- Cross-platform compatibility
- No internet dependency
- Fast processing (< 1 second per page)
- High reliability and repeatability

---

## Success Metrics

- Zero character loss
- Legal document acceptance
- <1% manual correction rate
- Stable output across machines

---

## Risks

- Incorrect rule ordering
- Incomplete mapping tables
- User selecting wrong source font

---

## Mitigations

- Script-aware rule engine
- Extensive test corpus
- Clear UI font selection
- Incremental rollout of font profiles
